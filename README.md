# Spring Generics
This library is a procedurally (eg 'shaded') extraction of the generics utilities from the `spring-core` module of
the [Spring Framework](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework) project. Spring has some of the smartest
generics resolution code available, but most developers are reluctant to bring a larger dependency like `spring-core`
into their projects. Well now you don't have to.


## Usage
Currently available in the UnquietCode maven repository. To use, add to your build script:

### Maven

```
